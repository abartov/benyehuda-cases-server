## post 1.0 
- task allocation screen
  - default to allocating within user's teams
  - allocate random task within team pool
- optionally specify team when requesting new task and member of multiple teams
- optionally self-allocate random task within team pool
- team discussion board?
- notifications to team leaders when volunteers join/leave? by preference?
- team status; archiving teams

== general todo ==
- fix sorting in task list views
+ send volunteers e-mails when works they were involved with have been uploaded.
  - As weekly cronjob, perhaps, updating about all uploads since last run.  No more than one e-mail per user per week!
