{"id":"t-bhu","title":"Epic: Celebrate volunteer anniversaries","description":"We want to encourage volunteer recognition by editors. To do that, we should highlight anniversaries of volunteers joining (based on created_at of their User record).\n\n0. Only active Users should be celebrated. That is, Users who have been activated and who are not on a break (or a freeze).\n\n1. When a user interacts with the app within one week (either direction) of their anniversary, show a celebratory message (use Rails I18n, and make the message in Hebrew, and gender-neutral) along the lines of \"It's been about %{N} years since you joined us! We greatly value your continuing contribution!\"\n\n2. In the admins dashboard (homepage) view, show near the top (under the menu/tab bar) a list of Users who are within one week (either direction) of their anniversary. Alongside each user, mention the number of years they have been registered, and add a button inviting the admin to send a greeting. Clicking the button should pop up a simple modal dialog with a canned message (something like \"I've noticed you have been volunteering with us for %{N} years now! That's fantastic!\") in a textarea, allowing them (and encouraging them, with a prompt) to edit it as they please and add a personal touch. Once they're happy with the message, they can click a Send button in the modal and the system should send that greeting to the User via email. There should also be a Cancel button to dismiss the dialog.  To help the admin personalize the message, the dialog should also show the volunteer's preferences and the latest 10 Tasks they have been assigned.\n\n3. Once an anniversary email has been sent by an admin to the user, they should no longer appear in the dashboard list. (So add a field congratulated_at to User, filling it when an email is sent, and check against this field before including users in the dashboard anniversaries list).\n\n\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-25T02:42:46.812044829+02:00","updated_at":"2025-12-25T03:52:22.964923121+02:00","closed_at":"2025-12-25T03:52:22.964923121+02:00","close_reason":"Implemented complete volunteer anniversary celebration feature with all requirements met"}
