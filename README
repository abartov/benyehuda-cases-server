This is a task management system supporting the workflow of Project Ben-Yehuda (http://benyehuda.org), a volunteer effort to digitize and make freely available Hebrew works that are in the public domain.

While it uses I18N libraries to localize its interface, it's really only designed to work right-to-left and in Hebrew.  It should be fairly easy to generalize, but the core team has no interest in expending effort to that end, so it is left to those interested in adapting the code.

The code is available for re-use under the GNU Affero General Public License http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html

We welcome patches, volunteer work, and interns interested in gaining experience with either the core technologies (Ruby on Rails, MySQL, HAML, etc.) or specific knowledge related to digitization and digital humanities.

To set up an environment, install RVM (http://get.rvm.io), and, on Ubuntu, I needed to install development libraries for MySQL and libxml2 to allow bundler to install the gems, so use something like:

  sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev libxml2-dev
